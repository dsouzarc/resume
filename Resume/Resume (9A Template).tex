\section{PROJECTS} {\sl Stock Calculator} \hfill Java Desktop App and Android Application \\
                Uses a custom algorithm to determine whether a stock's price will increase in the future.
                 \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt % reduce space between items
                 \item The algorithm downloads and takes into account the company's P/E and Beta Ratio, Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, and historical trading data
                \item Uses Data Parsing to display the stock's live quote, as opposed to other apps that only give 15-minute delayed quotes
                \end{itemize}
 
                {\sl App Searcher} \hfill            Android Application \\
                Google Play's fastest Android equivalent of iOS's built-in application searcher.
                 \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
                 \item Uses optimized algorithms and multithreading to load the user's list of installed apps four-five seconds faster then the competition's current load time. Speed is important when you want to open an app quickly.
                 \end{itemize} 
                 
                 \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt 
                 \item Memory Efficient: Uses 80\% less memory then its competition
                 \end{itemize}
                 
                 \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt

                   \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt 
                   \item Unique feature to share the event using QRCodes. Simply click on an already created event (or newly created event) and the option to share it via QR Code pops up. On the WeekView default screen, there is the option to Import a QRCode. When the QRCode is scanned, the event information is showed to the user who then can edit the event before saving it.
