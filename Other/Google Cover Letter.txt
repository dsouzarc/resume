Dear Hiring Manager,

	I understand your time is valuable. I’ll keep this to three bullet points. 	
	I’m interested in becoming a Software Engineering Intern at Google because of my passion for Computer Science. 
	While an intern, I plan on learning as much as I can about artificial intelligence and natural language processing, my two main interests in Computer Science. 
	I’d also love to work on making the Android development tutorials much more beginner friendly and work on adding additional features to the Android SDK.
	
Thank you for your time

Ryan D’souza
